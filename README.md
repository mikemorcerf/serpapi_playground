# SerpAPI Fun Playground

## üëã Introduction

This repo is for me to experiment using SerpApi and have fun with.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Install gems:
```
bundle install
```

Create `.env` file at the main directory and copy and paste your API key there:

Run the `main.rb` script to make the script run:
